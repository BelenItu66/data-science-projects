Mapping Change: CO₂ Emissions, Economy, and Climate’s Future
Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, economic development, and climate change. It explores CO₂ emission sources, their impact on global temperatures, and the correlation between GDP and emissions. Additionally, it examines how some economies have managed to decouple economic growth from emissions, offering sustainable pathways for the future.
Features
Analysis of CO₂ emission sources (coal, oil, natural gas, cement, gas flaring).
Examination of global temperature trends and the link between CO₂ emissions and climate change.
Exploration of GDP and carbon emissions correlation, including cases of absolute and relative decoupling.
Discussion of sustainable policies and clean energy solutions to balance emissions reduction and economic growth.
Data Collection & Processing
Data Sources:
The dataset was obtained from Our World in Data (OWID), a well-regarded source for global environmental and economic statistics.
Dataset Merging:
Two datasets were combined:
CO₂ Emissions Dataset – Contains global and country-level emissions from fossil fuels and industrial processes.
Temperature Anomaly Dataset – Records global temperature deviations relative to pre-industrial levels.
The datasets were merged based on time (years) and country-level data to analyze trends between emissions and climate change.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Removal of duplicate records and inconsistencies.
Standardization of units and measurement scales across datasets.
Handling of missing data using interpolation and verified estimates.
Normalization of values for improved comparability across regions and economic scales.
Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing and analysis.
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for static and interactive data visualization.
Why This Matters
CO₂ emissions are a key driver of climate change, and understanding their trends is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and businesses. This project provides data-driven insights to support decision-making and encourage sustainable economic growth.
How to Use This Project
For Researchers: Gain insights into CO₂ trends and economic correlations.
For Policymakers: Identify strategies for emission reduction without economic setbacks.
For Businesses: Explore sustainable solutions for reducing carbon footprints.
Conclusion
The transition to clean energy and sustainable policies can help reduce emissions while fostering economic growth. Understanding these trends is key to building a more sustainable and resilient future.
